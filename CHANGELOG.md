-----
* Breaking: Renamed `Root` type family to `NRoot`. Added `Sqrt` and `Cbrt` type
  synonyms. Added `sqrt` and `cbrt` for term level dimensions.
* Breaking: Changed Numeric.Units.Dimensional.Prelude to export dimensionally
  typed `signum`, `recip`, and `logBase` instead of the ones from `Prelude`.
* Breaking: Changed Numeric.Units.Dimensional.Prelude to export `(.)` and `id`
  from `Control.Category` instead of from `Prelude`.
* Breaking: Changed the `HasDimension` typeclass to require an instance of the new
  `HasDynamicDimension` typeclass.
* Breaking: Added operators for `AnyUnit` to the Numeric.Units.Dimensional.Dynamic
  module which may cause name collisions.
* Breaking: Added dynamic versions of `(*~)`, `(/~)`, and `siUnit` to the Numeric.Units.Dimensional.Dynamic
  module which may cause name collisions.
* Breaking: Removed exports of `nMeter`, `nSecond`, `kilo`, etc from Numeric.Units.Dimensional.UnitNames.
  Access these instead by inspecting the relevant units or prefixes.
* Breaking: Generalized the type of `dimensionlessLength` from
  `(Num a, Foldable f) => f (Dimensional v d a) -> Dimensionless a)` to
  `(Num a, Foldable f) => f b -> Dimensionless a`. This provides a weaker constraint on the type `a`
  and may result in ambiguous types in code that depends on the former less general type.
* Fixed a bug in the definition of the `inHg_NIST`.
* Fixed a bug in the interchange name of the Dalton.
* Added units for the US survey foot, yard, inch, mil, and mile.
* Added the short ton as a unit of mass.
* Clarified that the UCUM acre is based on the US survey foot.
* Added a version of the acre based on the international foot.
* Added `Data`, `Generic`, `Typeable` and `NFData` instances for many ancillary types.
* Added `unQuantity` to the Coercion module to ease unwrapping without
  introducing ambiguous type variables.
* Created explicit representation of metric `Prefix`es.
* Added a multiplicative `Monoid` instance for `AnyQuantity` and for `AnyUnit`.
* Added the `DynQuantity` type to represent possibly valid quantities of statically
  unknown dimension, suitable for performing arithmetic with such quantities.
* Added `nroot` function for term-level dimensions.
* Added the Numeric.Units.Dimensional.Float module with convenient wrappers around functions
  from RealFloat and IEEE for inspecting floating point quantities.
* Added an `AEq` instance for `Quantity`.
* Added `Eq1` and `Ord1` instances for `Quantity`.
* Exposed the name of an 'AnyUnit' without promoting it to a 'Unit' first.
* Exposed a way to convert atomic 'UnitName's back into 'NameAtom's.
* Added dynamic selection of metric prefixes based on the magnitude of a quantity to be displayed.
* Added the `btu`, a unit of energy.
* Added the `gauss`, a unit of magnetic flux density.
* Added the `angstrom`, a unit of length.
* Relocated git repository to https://github.com/bjornbm/dimensional
