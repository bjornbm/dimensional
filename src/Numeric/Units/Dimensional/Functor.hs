Provides a 'Functor' instance for 'Dimensional'.

Note that this instance is dubious, because it allows you to break the dimensional abstraction. See 'dmap' for more information.

Note that, while this instance overlaps with that given for 'Dimensionless', it is confluent with that instance.

Note that this is an orphan instance.
